# Variation Project

A modern web application designed to simplify the creation, management, and tracking of construction variation forms for builders and clients.

[Live Variation Project](https://variation-front-end.onrender.com/)

## üìã Overview

Variation forms are formal documents used to record and approve changes to the original scope of work outlined in a construction contract. They're essential for documenting amendments to agreements after they've been signed, ensuring all stakeholders are aware of the modifications.

This application digitizes the process, making it easier to create, submit, track, and maintain variation forms, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing administrative overhead in construction projects.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with Clerk
- **Profile Management**: Complete builder profile setup with company and partnership information
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple construction projects
- **Variation Tracking**: Add, edit, and track the status of variations for each project
- **Dashboard**: Centralized view of all projects and their variations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Solved

Traditional variation form processes in construction involve:

- Manual paperwork that's time-consuming to create
- Difficult to track across projects
- Prone to errors and miscommunication
- Hard to maintain proper records
- Delays in approval processes

The Variation Project solves these issues by:

1. **Simplifying Creation**: Templates and digital forms make creation quick and easy
2. **Standardizing Format**: All forms follow industry-standard templates
3. **Centralizing Records**: All variations are stored in one accessible location
4. **Streamlining Approvals**: Electronic submission and approval reduce wait times
5. **Automatic Syncing**: When clients approve variations, they're automatically updated for builders
6. **Reducing Administrative Burden**: Less time spent on paperwork means more time for actual construction

## üíª Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Context API**: For state management
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive UI components
- **React Router**: For navigation
- **Axios**: For API requests

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database (MongoDB Atlas cloud)
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling

### Authentication

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The application follows a modern architecture with:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with component-based architecture
- **Backend**: RESTful API built with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB collections for profiles, projects, and variations
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration for secure user management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
